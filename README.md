CultureHQ's SharePoint add-in.

## Getting started

Ensure you have `yarn` installed. In the root of the directory run `yarn` to install all dependencies. There are some configured `yarn` scripts to get development started:

* `yarn build` - Build a new distribution with `webpack`
* `yarn lint` - Lint the code with `eslint`
* `yarn start` - Start a local dev server with `webpack-dev-server`
* `yarn test` - Run the tests with `jest`
